Experience Summary
------------------

* Worked on processor verification of Synopsysâ€™ ARC family of processors, for around 10+ years
* Developed 2 :code:`Random Program Generators (RPG)` for processor level verification from scratch (Offline and Stepping)
* Got into touch with most of the processor features, while supporting them in the :code:`RPGs`
* Understood product management and design principles while designing the user interface and features taking regular feedback from around 50 verification engineers using the tool from time to time
* Managed the :code:`RPGs` end to end from preparing Road-maps to monitoring the product health
* Learned and deployed many product management tools like :code:`grafana`, :code:`gitlab's CI` and documentation tools like :code:`sphinx`
* Apart from :code:`RPGs`, worked on MLV of modules like MMU, AP, Cache Coherency and processor debug features
* Developed and maintained Co-Simulation environment for PLV
* Good with automation, developed and maintained several flows in verification
