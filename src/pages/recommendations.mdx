## NASA Tournament Lab Recommendation

Received a [letter of recommendation](/ntlLor.pdf) from the Harvard-NASA Tournament Lab for my
performance in the NASA Robots algorithmic challenge, administered by TopCoder, Inc. This was during
early years of my career when I was participating in lot of online coding competitions to improve my
coding skills.
