# Cursor Rules for krishvk.gitlab.io

## Page Titles

- **Always use short, concise titles for all pages that will appear in the left sidebar**
- Page titles should fit on a single line in the sidebar without wrapping
- Aim for titles that are 50 characters or less
- Use abbreviations when appropriate (e.g., "RPGs" instead of "Random Program Generators")
- Prioritize clarity and brevity over full descriptive names
- If a longer description is needed, use the page content or frontmatter description field

## Examples of Good Titles:
- "RPGs" ✓
- "Formal Education" ✓
- "C-Forge" ✓
- "Co-Simulation" ✓

## Examples of Titles to Avoid:
- "Random Program Generators (RPGs) for Processor Verification" ✗
- "AI-ML Log Analyzer for Verification Failure Triaging" ✗
- "Co-Simulation Environment for Processor-Level Verification" ✗

## Markdown Frontmatter

When creating new pages, ensure the `#` heading (H1) matches the sidebar title requirement:
- Keep H1 headings short and single-line
- Use H2 and H3 for detailed section headings within the page
- The H1 title will appear in the sidebar, so it must be concise

## Line Length

- **Limit all code and markup files to 100 characters per line**
- This applies to: `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.css`, `.md`, `.html`, `.json`, `.yml`, `.yaml`, and other code/markup files
- Break long lines appropriately to maintain readability
- Use proper indentation when wrapping lines
