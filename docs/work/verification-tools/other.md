# Other Contributions

## Regression Automation

Developed end-to-end regression automation flow for ARC processors, in use for over 10 years and
counting. The system automatically captures data into [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL)
database to drive dashboards. Guided improvements and enhancements to the flow with the help of
other engineers.

Key Features include

- Auto error bucketing for efficient failure categorization
- Auto linking of [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) tickets to failures based on
  predefined error signatures
- Auto capturing of coverage databases into a central location, providing a single point of truth
- Eliminated manual reporting overhead through automation

### OGE to LSF Migration

Guided the team of junior engineers in migrating the regression automation flow during the Synopsys
company wide migration from [OGE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Grid_Engine) to
[LSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Spectrum_LSF).

## Misc Projects

- Developed flows to verify IPXACT, BCR verification etc.
- Integrated DITA documentation into the verification flow, directly generating the ISA, CSR and
  other specifications to be consumed in verification flows from the documentation
