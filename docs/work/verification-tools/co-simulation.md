# Co-Simulation

Prototyped the experimental co-simulation flow to automate the verification of processor level
simulations. Worked with the team managing Golden model and implemented and maintained reusable
interface that can be used in multiple verification components. This environment which was later managed by a dedicated team became a critical
component of the verification infrastructure for Synopsys ARC processors.

## Key Features

- Seamless integration between testbenches and golden models
- Real-time synchronization and communication
- Support for complex processor architectures
- Scalable architecture for multiple processor variants
- Efficient communication protocols between simulation components

## Technical Implementation

- Developed communication protocols between simulation components
- Implemented synchronization mechanisms for accurate verification
- Created reusable framework for different processor configurations
- Optimized for performance and reliability

## Impact

- Enabled comprehensive processor-level verification
- Improved verification coverage and efficiency
- Reduced verification cycle time
- Supported verification of complex multicore architectures
- Enhanced debugging capabilities through integrated simulation
