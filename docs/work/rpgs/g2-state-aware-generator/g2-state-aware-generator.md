# G2: State Aware Generator

Developed a comprehensive SystemVerilog-based instruction stream generator that serves as a processor state-aware test generation framework. This generator provides a flexible and powerful environment for creating verification tests that are aware of the processor's internal state and can generate instruction streams based on coverage goals and verification requirements.

## Key Features

- **Processor State Awareness**: Generates instruction streams that are aware of the processor's current state, enabling more targeted and effective test generation
- **Coverage-Driven Generation**: Supports coverage-driven test generation through the Cov2gen feature
- **SystemVerilog Native**: Built entirely in SystemVerilog, enabling seamless integration with existing verification infrastructure
- **Flexible Architecture**: Provides a flexible framework for generating various types of instruction streams
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with testbenches and co-simulation environments

## Technical Approach

The SV-based generator leverages SystemVerilog's powerful features to create a state-aware instruction generation framework. It maintains awareness of processor state and can generate instruction streams that target specific verification scenarios and coverage goals.

## Components

- **Cov2gen**: Coverage-driven instruction stream generation feature that generates tests based on coverage requirements

## Impact

- Enabled more targeted test generation through processor state awareness
- Improved verification efficiency by generating relevant instruction streams
- Enhanced coverage through coverage-driven generation capabilities
- Seamless integration with existing SystemVerilog verification infrastructure
