# Random Program Generators (RPGs)

Designed, developed, and led the development of 3 RPGs for processor-level verification from
scratch, serving various generations of ARC processors. They follow different design philosophies
addressing the shortcomings of each other. They serve as the backbone of verification
infrastructure, supporting 50+ verification engineers across multiple product lines from time to
time in Synopsys' ARC processor family.

## Technical Challenges

- Handling complex multi-issue scheduling constraints
- Providing a flexible API framework for a wide range of test scenarios
- Managing different processor variants and configurations
- Supporting all processor features including multicore systems,
  [caches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache), [cache
  coherency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_coherence),
  [MMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit),
  [MPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_protection_unit),
  [VLIW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_long_instruction_word),
  [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD), and multi-issue pipes etc.

## Impact

- Boosted the productivity of verification engineers across multiple parallel product lines
- Significantly reduced test development time
