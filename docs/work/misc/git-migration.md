# Git Migration

Led the [Perforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perforce) to
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) migration process of entire ARC IP codebase including
(Design, Verification, Documentation repositories etc.) with 3 other engineers in the team. The team
executed the following steps to ensure the migration was smooth and without any data loss.

* Explored different offerings available within Synopsys (Ex: GitHub, GitHub Premium, Gitlab etc.)
* Identified the repositories to migrate
* Created a migration plan with minimal downtime of few hours per repo
* Ensured the history was preserved during the migration
* Explored various alternatives that port the history from Perforce to Git with minimal downtime
* Gathered the resources to help the team learn Git ecosystem
* Gave sessions to get the team ready for the migration
* Developed internal documentation and videos to bridge the gap between external resources and
   internal requirements
* Migrated the repositories
* Established the CI/CD infrastructure

The team received a special recognition for the effort from the senior management for the flawless
execution of the migration with zero data loss and minimal downtime.
