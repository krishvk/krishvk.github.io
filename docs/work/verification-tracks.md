# Verification Tracks

Handled end-to-end verification of `ISA Coverage`, `Action Points`, `MMU`, `Debug` features at `MLV`
and `PLV` levels. Analyzed the spec, debugged the failures, defined verification strategy and
verification plan, coverage metrics, implemented testbenches in `SystemVerilog`, coverage, test
cases etc.

Extensively supported the `Cache Coherency` verification by developing the testcases and features in
[G2](./rpgs/g2-state-aware-generator/g2-state-aware-generator.md) that aid the verification.
