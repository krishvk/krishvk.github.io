# Verification Tracks

Handled end-to-end verification of `ISA Coverage`, `Action Points`,
[MMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management_unit), `Debug` features at `MLV` and `PLV`
levels. Analyzed the spec, debugged the failures, defined verification strategy and verification
plan, coverage metrics, implemented testbenches in
[SystemVerilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog), coverage, test cases etc.

Extensively supported the [Cache Coherency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_coherence)
verification by developing the testcases and features in [G1](./rpgs/g1-offline-test-generator.md)
and [G2](./rpgs/g2-state-aware-generator/g2-state-aware-generator.md) that aid the verification.
