# Log Anomaly Detector

The Log Anomaly Detector is deployed and actively used in the verification workflow at work. This intelligent log analyzer tool automates the triaging of verification failure logs, significantly reducing the time domain experts spend analyzing log files.

> **Note**: This project was originally developed as part of my Master's thesis in Data Science & Engineering. See the [Academic project page](/academic/log-anomaly-detector) for detailed technical information about the development and research aspects.

## Deployment at Work

The Log Anomaly Detector has been successfully integrated into the verification infrastructure and is actively used by the verification team to:

- Automatically identify failure root causes in millions of log lines
- Reduce debugging time in verification failures
- Enable faster failure resolution through intelligent triaging
- Support the verification workflow with automated regression analysis

## Key Benefits in Production

- **Operational Efficiency**: Dramatically reduced time spent by domain experts in manual log file analysis
- **Scalability**: Handles large-scale log processing efficiently
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adapts to new failure patterns without requiring constant retraining
- **Integration**: Seamlessly works with existing verification infrastructure
