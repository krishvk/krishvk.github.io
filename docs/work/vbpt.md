# Verification Best Practices (VBPT)

Leading the Verification Best Practices team that consists of verification engineers from multiple
product lines and is responsible for continuous monitoring and improvement of product quality and
verification efficiency. The team works in parallel to product teams to provide verification
expertise and cultivate the best practices across product lines.

The team is responsible for

* Participating in audits and 8Ds to find out areas of improvement
* Experimenting and prototyping new tools and methodologies and introducing them to the team via
  articles or sessions as applicable
* Ensuring the team get adequate training on the new tools and methodologies in and out of Synopsys
* Ensuring the parallel product teams align on the methodologies
* Cross pollinate the best ideas across the product teams

## Team contributions

Few key contributions from the **team** under my leadership are

* Introducing
  [SystemVerilog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog) Coding Guidelines in the team

### Verification Plans

The VBPT has paved the path for the verification team through 3 generations of verification plans,
Excel based (Gen-1), HVP
([Verdi](https://www.synopsys.com/verification/debug/verdi.html)) based (Gen-2) and finally
[Jama](https://www.jamasoftware.com/) based (Gen-3). In each case the team has established templates
and guidelines around verification plans, built tools (Ex: Scripts to automate Spec Linking, Coverage
Back Annotation etc.) to ease the management. Gave sessions to get the team trained on the new tools.
Migrated the templates and checklists from older versions to the new ones where applicable.

## Individual Contributions

Apart from leading the team in driving the above initiatives, below are my individual contributions

### Workaround Management

Standardised the workaround management process invented during
[G1](../work/rpgs/g1-offline-test-generator) and [G2](../work/rpgs/g2-state-aware-generator) and
made the automation generic and reusable across the environment. This lets the verification
engineers and verification tools teams to move faster by workarounding known issues during the
development cycle. While the process and automation ensures the stale-workarounds are flagged in an
autogenerated [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) or
[reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) file that can be plugged into any
static documentation generators to provide a live UI.

### AI Integration

Worked with central engineering team and other teams across Synopsys to ensure the verification team
is equipped with latest AI tools like internal LLM based search engine, AI enabled IDEs etc. Got
internal docs enabled in the internal LLM based search engine to ensure team is equipped with latest
AI advancements before anyone else. Introduced tools like
[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot),
[Cursor](https://cursor.com/), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.ai/) etc. as part of this initiative.
