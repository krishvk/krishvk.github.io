# Personal Website

Built this personal website using Docusaurus to showcase my professional journey, projects, and
technical skillset. The site serves as a central hub for my resume, work history, and various
technical contributions across processor verification, infrastructure, and open-source development.

Developed using AI assistance, demonstrating effective use of cutting-edge AI technologies for rapid
prototyping and iterative development, even without being an expert in the tech-stack.
