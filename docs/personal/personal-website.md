# Personal Website

Built this personal website using Docusaurus to showcase my professional journey, projects, and
technical skillset. The site serves as a central hub for my resume, work history, and various
technical contributions across processor verification, infrastructure, and open-source development.

## Key Highlights

### AI-Powered Development

Developed entirely using AI assistance, demonstrating effective use of cutting-edge AI technologies
for rapid prototyping and iterative development. This "vibe-coded" approach enabled quick iteration
from initial architecture decisions through component implementation while maintaining code quality.

### Dynamic Skills Visualization

Automated skillset extraction system that parses project tags from markdown documentation and
generates interactive category-based visualizations, providing a comprehensive view of technical
capabilities.

### Automated Resume Generation

Integrated PDF resume generation that automatically syncs with website content, eliminating manual
updates and ensuring consistency between online and downloadable formats.
