# txtoflow

Developed [txtoflow](https://pypi.org/project/txtoflow/), an open-source Python library that
automatically generates flowcharts from pseudo-code written in C-like languages. This was more of a
pet-project while I was trying to learn the compilers and compilers internals. It was built on top
of [SLY](https://sly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sly.html), a Python implementation of [Lex and
Yacc](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/lex-yacc/9781565920002/) tools.
