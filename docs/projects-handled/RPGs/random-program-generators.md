# RPGs

## Overview

Designed, developed, and led the development of multiple Random Program Generators (RPGs) for processor-level verification from scratch. These tools serve as the backbone of verification infrastructure, supporting 50+ verification engineers across multiple product lines in Synopsys' ARC processor family.

## Key Achievements

- **Offline RPG**: Developed a lightning-fast generator from scratch that generates code patterns without communication with the golden model, enabling rapid test generation
- **Online RPG (Stepping)**: Built a context-aware program generator from scratch that communicates with the golden model for multi-issue SIMD processor verification
- **Python Environment**: Created a framework from scratch to generate random Application Extensions for verification
- **C-based Environment**: Developed a high-level language (HLL) test development environment from scratch to focus on scenarios rather than low-level details during test development
- **Product Management**: Managed RPGs end-to-end from roadmaps to monitoring product health, gathering regular feedback from 50+ users
- **Scalable Solutions**: Developed numerous reusable solutions for Test-TB communication, inter-core synchronization, and memory management

## Technical Challenges

- Handling complex multi-issue scheduling constraints
- Providing a flexible API framework for a wide range of test scenarios
- Improving probability of cache hits from random programs
- Reverse Generation Technique for functional verification
- Supporting all processor features including multicore systems, caches, cache coherency, MMU, MPU, VLIW, SIMD, and multi-issue pipes

## Impact

- Enabled comprehensive processor feature coverage through automated test generation
- Reduced test development time significantly
- Standardized verification methodologies across teams
- Supported verification of all processor features including multicore systems, caches, cache coherency, MMU, MPU, and more
- Managed product lifecycle from design to deployment, ensuring continuous improvement based on user feedback
