# Co-Simulation

## Overview

Designed and implemented a robust co-simulation environment that enables Processor-Level Verification by seamlessly integrating testbenches with golden reference models. This environment became a critical component of the verification infrastructure for Synopsys ARC processors.

## Key Features

- Seamless integration between testbenches and golden models
- Real-time synchronization and communication
- Support for complex processor architectures
- Scalable architecture for multiple processor variants
- Efficient communication protocols between simulation components

## Technical Implementation

- Developed communication protocols between simulation components
- Implemented synchronization mechanisms for accurate verification
- Created reusable framework for different processor configurations
- Optimized for performance and reliability

## Impact

- Enabled comprehensive processor-level verification
- Improved verification coverage and efficiency
- Reduced verification cycle time
- Supported verification of complex multicore architectures
- Enhanced debugging capabilities through integrated simulation
