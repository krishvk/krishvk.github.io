# AI-ML Log Analyzer

## Overview

Developed an intelligent log analyzer tool as part of my Master's thesis in Data Science & Engineering that automates the triaging of verification failure logs. This tool leverages machine learning techniques to classify and categorize failures, dramatically reducing manual effort in debugging.

## Key Features

- Automated failure log classification and categorization
- Pattern recognition in verification failures
- Intelligent triaging to reduce debugging time
- Integration with existing verification infrastructure
- Machine learning models for log analysis

## Technical Approach

- Applied machine learning models for log analysis
- Developed pattern matching algorithms for failure classification
- Created automated workflows for log processing
- Implemented data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Built classification models using scikit-learn

## Impact

- Significantly reduced verification cycles spent on log analysis
- Improved debugging efficiency
- Enabled faster failure resolution
- Demonstrated practical application of AI-ML in hardware verification
- Automated repetitive debugging tasks
