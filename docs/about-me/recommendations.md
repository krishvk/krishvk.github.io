# Recommendations

## NASA Tournament Lab Recommendation

I received a letter of recommendation from the Harvard-NASA Tournament Lab for my performance in the NASA Robots algorithmic challenge, administered by TopCoder, Inc.

The algorithmic challenge was designed to measure computational, critical, and cognitive thinking skills, requiring contestants to combine these skills with the ability to iteratively implement various approaches using a programming language under time and performance constraints. The challenge posed an algorithmic development problem considered one of the most difficult in the TopCoder platform suite.

I competed against nineteen other contestants and finished **4th** in the competition. The letter, signed by Karim R. Lakhani (Associate Professor, Harvard Business School, and Principal Investigator, Harvard-NASA Tournament Laboratory), offers highest recommendations without reservation, noting that my algorithmic skills, as demonstrated by this contest, would be a valuable asset to any organization looking for analytic and computational talent.
